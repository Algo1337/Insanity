The problem is, how can I store the order of messages between client 1 and client 2, for example, bearing in mind that client 1 may also be communicating with client 3? thank you.

ps: sending and receiving messages does not go through the server. the server only has the role of registering new clients (checking a psk) and sending the current udp configuration via multicast to all registered clients.

[ MESSAGE ]: nofunadler: you can have the clients keep track of the order themselves. i.e. client A sends a message to client B - client A plug its msg number in the message somewhere (lets say the header). e.g. `1 ... ... ... ...` client B stores that `1` somewhere and expects `2`. if it receives anything other than `2` it'll know something got messed up.
same goes in the other direction, client B's first msg to client A will be marked as `1` (or `2`, depends if you want to keep track of the order of the entire 'conversion' or no).
you can scale this up to any number of clients as long as you start from a well known, agreed upon number

[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: actually... looking carefully at OP's log, the installation error is from numpy, not opencv
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: well it at least allows using separate names for XMACRO
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: that is a nicer api
[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: so what's happening is that it for some reason tries to compile *numpy* instead of installing it from wheel
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: yeah actually

[ MESSAGE ]: enduser: Hi
I use PyScripter (5.0.0) and intend to start using venv for my test projects. For today, I simply created a basic window using PyQt6. 
Before I do, I created and activated a virtual environment and PyScripter recognized the new Python.exe just fine. 

My worry is that I don't know if it's ok to close the terminal (CMD) while running the IDE. Basically, will this affect the project in any way? Does using the designated Python.exe file guarantee that any changes to the code will not affect the overall project negatively, which is supposed to run in the virtual environment, or do I need to always keep CMD open until I decide to deactivate venv? 

Note that I have the option to switch between the different Python.exe files in the IDE but I've neither closed and reopened it, nor closed CMD for the reasons above; so I'll put my PC on Sleep mode if necessary but not shut it down.

[ MESSAGE ]: eisenwave: complaining is a much easier problem
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: The choice only affects the command line flag style, not whether Clang is gonna use msvc abi/libs or mingw abi
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: Well yeah, obviously
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: Only that?
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Yes
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: What if clang has some flag that msvc doesnt
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: also do this
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Such as?
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: U dont have it on clangcl?
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: Btw that reminds me.. at work we use marvel character names for the IT full admin accounts
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: Idk im just saying
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: I think there are ways to escape those the flags, but I don't remember how

[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: When my buddy switched from R&D to IT, he had to pick a name.. so he went through the list and decided to troll a little
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: For me the problem was usually the reverse, I know a cl flag and not sure how to spell it in the regular clang. Such as selecting the C runtime
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: Yeah
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: I was about to say that
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: There CMake helped a lot, since it knows how to do all that. You can compile a test project and look at what flags it passes

[ MESSAGE ]: whynotgs: pip 25.1.1 from c:\Users\whyno\Desktop\New folder\.venv\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.14)

[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: I think ill go with clang cl
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: try downgrading to last release version
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: it might not have an package for 3.14b
[ MESSAGE ]: qwinci: as long as you were using core 3.3 I think it should be
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: Turns out there is a marvel character called "Hauptmann Deutschland".. that character was formerly called "Vormund"
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: Then how normal  clang knows?
[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: ah, well, that explains it. I'm not sure opencv and numpy support 3.14 at all yet, and they definitely don't ship wheels for it

[ MESSAGE ]: 8ballguru: yea lmao

[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: First time I saw an email by vormund@company.de I thought it's spam lol
[ MESSAGE ]: whynotgs: how do i downgrade
[ MESSAGE ]: sanisensei: uninstall 3.14
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: Just download the exe from python website
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: it will do the job for you
[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: just uninstall python from "add and remove programs" and install 3.13 or 3.12 instead
[ MESSAGE ]: whynotgs: okie
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: isnt python doing it if it detects newer version?
[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: no; on windows it's entirely valid to have multiple python versions
[ MESSAGE ]: arstop: oh ok
[ MESSAGE ]: doctor4rats: can anyone help me with this?
[ MESSAGE ]: enduser: *I wouldn't care much for simple stuff but I don't know if I'll end up growing the project a lot. Also please tag me if you reply
[ MESSAGE ]: sanisensei: <salespitch> or use `uv` instead </salespitch>
[ MESSAGE ]: qwinci: there is a different target you can select, which one it uses by default depends on a setting you set when compiling clang itself
[ MESSAGE ]: leduyquang753: Does the C++ standard not define what a trap representation is or does it delegate to C?
[ MESSAGE ]: frityet: Shit I actually have a really good idea for this
[ MESSAGE ]: qwinci: --target=x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc and --target=x86_64-unknown-windows-gnu
[ MESSAGE ]: frityet: Studying for exams can wait
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: LOL
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Knows what? Whether to use msvc abi or mingw abi? By whatever `--target` you pass. The default value can be hardcoded when compiling clang.
Or which specific MSVC installation to use? It can use the same env variables set by vcvars (I think it reads just like one variable, but I don't remember which one)
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: send it later then
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: i also had a good idea

[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: grill/fried/baked? any marinade?
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: yea i loved it
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: fried
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: it was so good
[ MESSAGE ]: opalmist: I'm always stressed.
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: but it took like 3 hours to make
[ MESSAGE ]: confusedreptile: I'd expect this to fail; the windows builds of python are compiled with MSVC and AFAIK you must use specifically MSVC to compile binary packages for it. unless that specific compiler does something weird
[ MESSAGE ]: opalmist: That's my base state of being.
[ MESSAGE ]: sasbom: what part of octopus did u use
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: u first have to clean it then boil it then do all the frying
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: the legs
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: Looks more like iron deficiency man ngl
[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: i kept seeing octopus in the store, was tempted to try but ive never made that
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: it was nice
[ MESSAGE ]: anshu_528: but what happen

[ MESSAGE ]: sasbom: yes that's a thing that totally works too
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: ye i also heard that but i think that's what u do with fresh octopus
[ MESSAGE ]: frityet: I made a reflection library for C
[ MESSAGE ]: ooliver: oh that's fine
[ MESSAGE ]: 8ballguru: octopi
[ MESSAGE ]: google_heimer: mine was a bit not fresh
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: AND also there's ANOTHER english paper on FRIDAY man

[ MESSAGE ]: sasbom: awesome
[ MESSAGE ]: ooliver: yes I didn't have a choice

[ MESSAGE ]: entronid: > A Request for Comments (RFC) is a publication in a series from the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).[1][2] An RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts, information, or, occasionally, engineering humor.[3]

You might be writing most of the same thing on a command line app, discord bot, web app, custom protocol, etc. But if you do make a web API you still have to learn about the web and those specific details but you can do it without specific framework details, you can just build up your logic and then call into it and present the results. You treat it as UI code with some extra, still important but isolated details. Then when you deal with it what goes there and what to do is crystal clear.

You mean, you are keeping the terminal with an activated venv open? That's not necessary; nothing will happen to the venv when you close the terminal. It's up to the IDE to notice there's a venv in the project's folder and run it instead of the global Python installation.

I interpret cpp reference documentation relax order to not be used for circular dependent atomic objects, "/y is dependent on x" is given in the cpp reference example.

//In a cppcon talk about atomics Fedor Pikus a "counter" example, where there is no y oand x objects, 
//only a one "counter" that is commutative. I provide a link to the mark in the video, its the end QA part of the talk.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQFzMfHIxng&t=3820s

//And the code example is a literally a counter.
//So i make the conclusion that relax could be used because there is only one/same object (that is incremented eg. coounter).

[ MESSAGE ]: ab9rf: this is a semantic argument mostly. the CPU has execution contexts, which at the CPU level are often called either "threads" or "processes". older CPU designs typically call these processes, newer ones call them threads, due largely due to changes in language over time. the distinction between "threads" and "processes" that is generally seen in modern OSes is at the operating system level, and refers to how the _OS_ manages those objects, _not_ the CPU. in threading models that are derived from the original multithreading model developed at Sun, each process contains one or more threads, and all of the threads within each process share the same memory resources. operating systems that aren't conceptually descended from the Sun multithreading model may have a different approach to mapping threads of execution to processes or memory resources

```cpp

    ssize_t statCode = 1;

    while(statCode > 0){

    }
    if(pipe(pipe_from_prog1) == -1){

    }

    pid_t id = fork();
    if(id == 0){
        //prog1
        close(pipe_from_prog1[0]); //prog1 doesn't read from this
        close(pipe_to_prog1[1]); //prog1 doesn't write to this

        if(dup2(pipe_from_prog1[1], STDOUT_FILENO) == -1){
            perror("dup2");
            std::exit(1);
        }
        close(pipe_from_prog1[1]);

        if(dup2(pipe_to_prog1[0], STDIN_FILENO) == -1){
            perror("dup2");
            std::exit(1);

        execl("prog1", "prog1", nullptr);
    }
    else{
        close(pipe_to_prog1[0]); //main doesn't read from this
        close(pipe_from_prog1[1]); //main doesn't write to this
        std::string inp;
        readStringFromFd(pipe_from_prog1[0], inp);

        std::cout << "From main: prog1 outputted " << inp << std::endl;
        write(pipe_to_prog1[1], "yes\n", 5);

        close(pipe_from_prog1[0]);
        close(pipe_to_prog1[1]);
        wait(nullptr);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
This is prog1.cpp:
```cpp
int main(){
    int ans = 10;
    std::cerr << "From prog1: ans = " << ans << std::endl;
    std::cout << ans << std::endl;

    std::string response;
    std::cin >> response;

    std::cerr << "I received: " << response << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

`From prog1: ans = 10`

Not all of these are equally important and it's arguably subjective and opinionated but if you're exposed to more you can get an idea of what you think is simple and what other people do. But there's also a lot of bad examples out there too which are popular so it's all a mixed bag. But principles and pragmatism and aiming for simplicity is important and knowing what other people do.

[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: Getting a stack trace on an exception is tricky, you have to be able to collect the trace while the stack is still in tact. The cpptrace try/catch blocks do some trickery to intercept exception handling internals and make a trace before the stack unwinds. A future is difficult though, by the time .get is called and sees an exception the stack has already been unwound. I haven’t explored this in depth so I’m not sure if there are any tricks that could be used but I would recommend wrapping your async code in something that can catch an exception and attach it

[ MESSAGE ]: fremko: So there is this interesting vision model https://moondream.ai/c/playground that i am trying to understand how it works, specifically the pointing feature (inputs, architecture and as much as possible). 


my confusion starts pretty much at the first line of code in the point function https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream2/blob/main/moondream.py#L534

snippet: 
```py
def point(
        self,
        image: Union[Image.Image, EncodedImage],
        object: str,
        settings: Optional[ObjectSamplingSettings] = None,
    ):
        if self.config.tokenizer.templates["point"] is None:
            raise NotImplementedError("Model does not support pointing.")

        image = self.encode_image(image)
        self.load_encoded_image(image)

        prompt_tokens = torch.tensor(
            [
                self.config.tokenizer.templates["point"]["prefix"]
                + self.tokenizer.encode(" " + object).ids
                + self.config.tokenizer.templates["point"]["suffix"]
            ],
            device=self.device,
        )

        _, hidden, next_token, pos = self._prefill_prompt(
            prompt_tokens, image.pos, temperature=0, top_p=0
        )
        hidden = hidden[:, -1:, :]

        max_objects = (
            settings.get("max_objects", DEFAULT_MAX_OBJECTS)
            if settings
            else DEFAULT_MAX_OBJECTS
        )
        objects = self._generate_points(
            hidden, next_token, pos, include_size=False, max_objects=max_objects
        )

        return {"points": objects}```

```py
def encode_image(self, image: Union[Image.Image, EncodedImage]) -> EncodedImage:
        if isinstance(image, EncodedImage):
            return image
        elif not isinstance(image, Image.Image):
            raise ValueError("image must be a PIL Image or EncodedImage")

        # Run through text model in addition to the vision encoder, to minimize
        # re-computation if multiple queries are performed on this image.
        with torch.inference_mode():
            img_emb = self._run_vision_encoder(image)
            bos_emb = text_encoder(
                torch.tensor([[self.config.tokenizer.bos_id]], device=self.device),
                self.text,
            )
            inputs_embeds = torch.cat([bos_emb, img_emb[None]], dim=1)
            mask = self.attn_mask[:, :, 0 : inputs_embeds.size(1), :]
            pos_ids = torch.arange(inputs_embeds.size(1), dtype=torch.long)
            self._prefill(inputs_embeds, mask, pos_ids)

        return EncodedImage(
            pos=inputs_embeds.size(1),
            caches=[
                (
                    b.kv_cache.k_cache[:, :, : inputs_embeds.size(1), :].clone(),
                    b.kv_cache.v_cache[:, :, : inputs_embeds.size(1), :].clone(),
                )
                for b in self.text.blocks
            ],
        )```

```py
    def _prefill(self, x: torch.Tensor, attn_mask: torch.Tensor, pos_ids: torch.Tensor):
        return text_decoder(x, self.text, attn_mask, pos_ids, self.config.text)```
what does `image = self.encode_image(image)` do

why does `encode_image(image)` call `self._prefill` if it is a text decoder and has nothing to do with the image?

I assume it is somehow related to KV cache.

[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: In case you didn't know, you can pass the `-S` flag to gcc and it will output the assembly instead of an executable (or you can use e.g. https://godbolt.org/, which probably makes this a little nicer).
[ MESSAGE ]: nevemlaci: No I mean they literally want you to just memorize a bunch of formulas, that is the whole class

[ MESSAGE ]: _keepaway: i made a code for a custom crosshair for some of my friends to use and idk if there is an alternative way
[ MESSAGE ]: bharadwajraju: if you want to develop apps for Windows then using Windows as your OS is probably the best
[ MESSAGE ]: bharadwajraju: with a VM being a close second
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: i mean ngl i hate how slow vscode is too. i appreciate the startup time much more, and my latency concerns are to do with the language servers anyway. editors are kinda just fast once your system is powerful enough (unless you're talking about atom, which is slow on everything. fuck atom)

[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: as much as relaxed order can work in the right scenarios, I just very fundamentally dislike the rule of thumb you're kinda enunciating there
rules of thumb are nice to help simplify known and well understood/common patterns, and it's a bit too easy to fall into complacency if you apply a rule of thumb without realizing it doesn't actually apply to the problem you're tackling
and in a bunch of other contexts, it's perfectly fine because the consequence for getting it wrong is just worse performance, but still correct code/behaviour
with memory order "getting it wrong" very quickly implies wrong/incorrect behaviour

and for this specifically, it gets me doubly riled up, because you very rarely need "just a counter"

say you mainly have a counter that is not interleaved with any other thing, that you mainly increment
if it's the only thing you do with it the counter is for the most part useless and achieves nothing, typically there is always some point where you will need to observe the value of the counter to do something, even if it is only printing logs with the counter's "current" value
what kind of guarantee you need with respect to how "up to date" that counter value actually is, has implications about how you can/cannot structure the rest of your program, and whether you can indeed use a relaxed order for manipulations of that counter
and yes usually at that point it's not just about the one counter anymore and typically it will involve other synchronization primitives around that counter, but that is the point I'm making, what kind of guarantee do you need (or do not) for the program to be considered "working"

"python is super efficient" in terms of what ?? using resources ? speed ? 

you said "python is smoother" , and then you said "smoother means dynamic" , so are you trying to say "python is smoother dynamically" ?? makes no sense to me 

and if you say that "python code makes the movement of robot arms smoother" , then that has no meaning because you should be able to do everything in C++ as well. 

the things taht cause movements to be not smoother is code. if you write bad code , teh movement will not smooth , regardless of if code is python or c++.

dynamically typed languages take up more resources than compiled ones. and resources is the one thing that we dont have much of when it comes to microcontrollers.

[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Of course
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: No circuit design skill involved, this is a stock 5V relay board powered from a phone charger, but it works
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: If you put a function in a namespace the namespace's name is used as the prefix, after that a :: is added and then the function's name follows
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: At 13 characters, machine random, with A-Z a-z 0-9 and symbols you’re at the wall for bruteforce by any adversary
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: For example: std::print
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Regardless of their compute or even the hashing involved, if we ignore hashes that truncate input like LM or descrypt
[ MESSAGE ]: aadithya_a: so ```tldr``` is what ? a site ?
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: Why "using a C program"? There are several languages where finding that out would be much easier.
Python for example:
```py
import os

print(os.path.exists("folder1/subfolder1"))  # prints 'True'
```and it's cross-platform
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: I mean a password manager kinda does because you just click autofill
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: A lot of these headaches are basically caused by the fact that set and dict cannot enforce their keys not changing. So as a workaround the language tries to avoid implementing hash for mutable types

[ MESSAGE ]: yeoldtoasty: I mostly feel like I need to ship fast. The deadlines are pretty vague/relaxed though. I haven't been asked to ship faster yet, but I feel the peer pressure. Everyone else on the team had more time with the project and moves quite quick so I feel like I need to be as fast as them.
It may also be related to the fact that I consider that I'm not fit for the job, in the sense that I'm underskilled. I don't consider myself to have the necessary level of competence and experience for the company I work at. I probably wouldn't even be able to pass the standard interview, I think I was just really lucky with the interviews for the internship as well as the tasks that I got assigned during the time I interned here.

[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Yeah, there’s a few very specific cases where it’s useful still
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: But that doesn't explain why you want to use C or shell scripting. Usually you would use C if you want a more performant solution, but your issue sounds like it: 
- Waits for user input
- a simple exists check 
- grab the files from the directory
- organize them (whatever that means)

That does not sound like you'd need the speed, so why is your organization tool written in C in the first place?

[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Rainbow or lookup?
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: 2FA is annoying
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: But it is the only way
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: - It is not right. It is a good thing to have tests executed on every commit by CI like Github Actions.
- You are supposed to submit your Pull Requests always having tests running green before merging to master branch.
- When u are lazy person an author of the project u can be having sometimes tests few tests broken, and as long as application is not actually broken from them broken, it can be fine temporally due to you writing too big new feature but it will be your first responsibility to repair them back to get good things back on track. Until u did not repair, your app state in a sorry state not friendly for other devs to step in until u cleared your mess. (it does not matter if u are single dev on the project, we all aim to have our projects to be eventually shared with other people)
- Sometimes u can be having tests getting broken because of flakky tests, smth gets broken from time to time due to tests running to same local database dependency. That's more tricky to fix and annoying, but still it is your responsibility to take care of

[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Where could i possibly get online internship or opportunities.. are chances so much low when compared to on site
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: I know python uses tons of dicts internally but I thought they basically always had string keys
[ MESSAGE ]: argarchive: only way for what???
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: if your tests remain broken and nobody fixes them as first priority => That means you fucked up unit testing and became cold-hearted to them / dissapointed due to them not being implemented right.

[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: That is kind of... well, a start to project downfall
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: So how do you generate entry points and chains
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: A project with more code will tend to have more files, yes
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: A sort maybe?
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: From there things can snowball further, code will be more and more written without them
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: is this true
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: Active contributors who care about the software
[ MESSAGE ]: mage7717: could just check the return code from `ls` in that case. `ls <some file path>` returns 0 on success, and 2 on failure when i tried it just now
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Actually it no longer chokes for me, interesting
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: older tests instead of being fixed or properly maintained, will be just further ignored as more of them get broken
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: In no particular order:
- README doc
- Wiki or ReadTheDocs site
- Unit Testing
- Pipelines for CI/CD
- License

These are what I look for in an organized git project. But that is of my opinion
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: and you end up with project in a such sorry state that it becomes easier to rewrite from scratch than to continue
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: Useful software that people like using is typically more than a few hundred lines. Well, depends
[ MESSAGE ]: edot2times: mmmm
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: i just remembered the source code for neofetch lol
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: it plagues my mind
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Ah yeah, a non-meme license

[ MESSAGE ]: shenanigansd: Is it bad?
[ MESSAGE ]: keerhes: 
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Perhaps ask your manager what they want? Faster results of better code
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: yea but people still insist on using it for some reason
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: you lost your saving Swimming Ring thing, and your project became as shitty as it could be for projects written without unit testing
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: What development could it possibly need?
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: It's one file
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: So whats the new "neofetch" nowadays?
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: it's fine, only 11.6k lines
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Whats the use of CI/CD are these stuff like pre commit which is run before pushing stuff
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: screenfetch?
[ MESSAGE ]: argarchive: weren't they moving into device stuff?
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: `cloc` is also a one-file program with like 10k lines of perl
[ MESSAGE ]: asmund101: ..
[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: Say you give the tool a hash and a link to rockyou, if rockyou doesnt already have an sql (or rocksdb in this case) table, it will iterate over the list and compute a set of common hashes like sha256/512 md5 so on and store those each in columns of the rockyou table

[ MESSAGE ]: nou2917: https://youtu.be/wEMccEwaBtU?si=kD443qU6iN1YIMC9
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: That’s a lookup table
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Not a rainbow table
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Because at least where I work, the better code is much more important. I've seen how poor code rots over time and causes issues, and we have this even without interns
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: I use fastfetch
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Rainbow tables are vastly more complicated
[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: What's the difference?
[ MESSAGE ]: argarchive: thanks
[ MESSAGE ]: bharadwajraju: there are a million *fetch programs because they're so easy to make
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: They don’t store hashes
[ MESSAGE ]: enduser: I see, thanks
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: Its basically automated testing before merging the new code into production. It won't merge if it fails the tests.
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: You are students though, your project codes will never be big enough and long enough maintained for that to matter
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: I'll have a quick look
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: I've literally never cared about neo fetch Performance. Half the time I run it by curl | sh
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: You precompute a set of entry points to long chains of keyspace based on their outputs and store just that
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Then lookups are performed by redoing the hashes for the relevant chains
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: it will matter only for projects like pet projects or work projects that are intended to be maintained more than few months
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: Some people run it at terminal startup
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Well, | bash
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Its like a really wacky compression system
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Regarding you being underskilled, this isn't your job to judge. Your job is to work 9-5 (or whatever) and produce the best code you can
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: and there's no downside to being faster
[ MESSAGE ]: zxuiji: How would I go about that? Never tried to install windows builds to my `~/.wine` before.  Until recently the only way I used wine was either via steam in proton or by just double clicking the `*.exe` file
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: if u wish to have proper pet project that u maintain for years and for it to grow in quality as your skills grow, u should have unit testing properly maintained to it
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: Its not available on Ubuntu
[ MESSAGE ]: mage7717: no, just in my shell. it should behave identically in `system()`, though, `man system` says
>  The  system()  library  function behaves as if it used fork(2) to create a child process that executed the shell command specified in command using execl(3) as follows:
>  execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", command, (char *) NULL);
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Hm why can't it just be few python files which does the testing
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: Someone's github
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: Ah yes, I frequently forget what distro I'm using. Very useful information
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Pytest
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Yeah, but like... It's a single bash script, it's not going to be optimized.
[ MESSAGE ]: itzjustfelix.: Just learnt django just from reading their docs (i consider that an achievement lol)
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: It's your manager's job to determine if your results are good enough or not, so don't bother worrying. Perhaps study in your free time to improve your skills if you feel you need to
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: if u have work project, u should be again desiring to have properly maintained unit tests, otherwise it will be mental insanity to maintain and integrate changes with other participating devs
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: It’s pretty space efficient, at the cost of a TON more compute to generate and then also for lookups
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: You incorporate whatever testing suite you want into the CI/CD pipelines
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: It can be, you just need to get GitHub to run them for PRs
[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: Oh i see
[ MESSAGE ]: anonymous4045: which is why I don't use it lol
[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: Thats a lot smarter than what we're doing lol
[ MESSAGE ]: argarchive: what should i be doing to set up projects
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Lookup tables are a lot less efficient than rainbow tables, but also a lot more flexible
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Yeah, that's fine, but it doesn't need further development
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: So, it is not big matter for you today that u lost this game since it is university project, but if it was anything else, it would be a problem
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: It's fine as is
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Understood
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Personally, I wouldn’t recommend either though
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: (until it runs out of logos?
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: As both will be slower than just rerunning the keyspace on GPU
[ MESSAGE ]: xsumer: hey im new to python and i have a project idea i wanna do in the future if i can run by it someone to see how realistic it is
[ MESSAGE ]: migrita12: Hell yeah
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: So CI/CD is pretty much making sure test pass

[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: Ofc
[ MESSAGE ]: tinoy: well it can be, it's about workflows that trigger when you make a commit
[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: ass where is seasoning
[ MESSAGE ]: xsumer: i wanna make some sort of bot or code that can bsaicly list a pair of shoes on either my own website or ebay, just make a draft of it with the info of the shoe and all you have to do as a lister is to look at the draft and set a price and list it
[ MESSAGE ]: mage7717: `echo $?`
[ MESSAGE ]: migrita12: I do welding at home too brother

[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: she loves it gentle
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Ok guys understood, thanks

[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: So running a bunch of hashes on GPU doesn’t degrade your speed almost at all
[ MESSAGE ]: mage7717: `?` is a shell variable that holds the return value of the last command. running `echo` (or anything else) will therefore overwrite it upon completion
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: 10 and 10000000 hashes both run the same speed
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: u should desire having it always because writing code that u don't maintain is usually... a lost effort of time?
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Seems like they do, tho it's a little unwieldy. Should be doable.
[ MESSAGE ]: anshu_528: sleeeepyy
[ MESSAGE ]: chick3nman: Whereas lookups are always more costly the more you have to do
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: it is always more impressive as u continue maintaining smth and deloping in features in long term

[ MESSAGE ]: kilozz: i crash out every time i see you
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: until then... it will be often easier to abandon and rewrite from scratch than to continue, is is common thing for student projects to be so, but it would be nice to grow out of this phase as soon as u can

[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: I like making websites
[ MESSAGE ]: mayorc2004: Say it to my artist
[ MESSAGE ]: pickleas_cage: I've not seen the full talk so forgive me if I'm repeating it, but the simple example is probably like this
```cpp
void thread_1(int& value, std::atomic<bool>& is_configured){
  value = configure_value(...);
  is_configured.store(true);
}

void thread_2(int& value, std::atomic<bool>& is_configured){
  //Wait for configuration
  while(not is_configured.load());

  do_things_with(value);
}

int main(){
  int value{};
  std::atomic<bool> checker{false};

  std::thread t1{thread_1, std::ref(value), std::ref(checker)};
  std::thread t2{thread_2, std::ref(value), std::ref(checker)};

  t1.join();
  t2.join();
}
```
Think about that code. Thread 1 sets a value then sets the atomic to true to say "this has been checked". Thread 2 waits until the atomic is true and then reads the value. Now, the question I ask is - is thread 2 guaranteed to see the value of `value` as set in thread 1?

Your normal programming instincts should say yes - thread 2 is guaranteed to wait until thread 1 has set up the value. But the answer is not quite so simple. If all memory ordering of the atomic were relaxed, then you would have no guarantee at all. Thread 2 might have its own cached version of `value` which doesn't receive the update before it gets read. That lack of guarantee is the normal and expected behaviour of relaxed memory ordering. So you need something else. You need a way to tell the program to make sure that when thread 2 reads the atomic, it synchronises with any changes made in some other thread which might be important. It makes sure that if it reads a `true` value from the atomic, then it also reads the updated value of `value`.
[ MESSAGE ]: tonabrix1: It all comes full circle
[ MESSAGE ]: darkwind8: unit testing ensures it is done automatically and does not take more than minutes of time (they can be executed dozens of minutes, but since they are done automatically and by CI, it is not that much bothersome)
[ MESSAGE ]: joucejc: like new york vs some random rural town in ohio

[ MESSAGE ]: mayorc2004: He is credited in my bio

[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: But find it's repetitive.
[ MESSAGE ]: qoyyuum: I guess, make better ones? Like a social network or something?
[ MESSAGE ]: argarchive: honestly i don't understand most of these cli tools like pip i just rote learned a few important commands
[ MESSAGE ]: silkovh: I’ll check the average salary in that state
[ MESSAGE ]: yoyo2002021: Same setup all tome
[ MESSAGE ]: silkovh: Not hard
[ MESSAGE ]: pickleas_cage: This is where the memory ordering comes in. If you don't specify a memory ordering, you get sequential consistent which would guarantee it in this case but which also guarantees things across threads such that every thread agrees on a single modification order of your variables. If you use acquire-release you can refine it slightly so that only threads which acquire a released update synchronise. And if you use relaxed, as we said, you don't get any synchronisation guarantees at all.

[ MESSAGE ]: praisepancakes: when invoking a templated function that constructs T  :

          //constructs a T and returns it

is there a way for the linter to know T's args? currently when calling bind the linter displays something like when typing the args out :
```c++
T & bind<T, Args...>(uint64_t e, Args &&...args)

[ MESSAGE ]: polllaris: Some of it does though it's less emphasized in it if I recall correctly. The patterns in it can help with it though if applied in better capacities and some of them are still in use (just better) like the repository pattern, unit of work pattern, and it goes over a lot of concepts such as transactions and a lot regarding the design of interfaces on a network like how when designing an interface for other code to use you want a fine grained interface but with the time it takes to go over a network and back you want it more coarse grained, which is an important factor when it comes to API design, also explains what to do for deadlocks, how to handle concurrency and a lot of amazing stuff.

it has a different approach imo: it starts from the observation that any code will become legacy (and likely use patterns that will be obsolete). from there, it asks a very natural question: knowing it's/will be there, how do we cope with it? what kind of strategy should we use when working with this code? 

and eventually I found it interesting because it kind of stresses points you wouldnt think about in an optimistic perspective where "you find the best decisions"

You should also read materials like hexagonal architecture which has a few ideas (and a combination of a few too) that you can't find explained so well anywhere else, primarily the idea of driver code that calls into your code, at least to me it was eye opening because when you think of an adapter for your code to use, you think of writing something to let it drive the program, handle networking,etc, but instead you can have a piece go on top independently and separate and pass input to your code and present results. It's not as opinionated as domain driven design, clean architecture, etc, but a lot of interesting ideas. read the original document which is free if you want more than just buzzwords around it.

[ MESSAGE ]: amya420: oh
[ MESSAGE ]: tiffanyhowellssagen: thats a bit weird
[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: 
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: So do you just recommend "C with classes"
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: those abstractions are voluntary
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: What do you mean? It offers the same syntax and semantics?
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: but the business problem is well described through all of it's componants
[ MESSAGE ]: amya420: <@1171751078488977428> is a random
[ MESSAGE ]: strixlake: and clang is still somehow slower than msvc
[ MESSAGE ]: tiffanyhowellssagen: agreed
[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: 
[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: lizards solo
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: yeah I guess it was the initial intent
[ MESSAGE ]: alplusplus: oh thats just detecting objc
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: C with classes moment
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: whereas in C++ we tend to produce better solutions, but it's Jazzy
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: I certainly don't, but if you want to do learn those low level things it's not a problem to do it in cpp
[ MESSAGE ]: strixlake: By about ~0.5s in both naive and transposed matmul
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: and can't be described and doccumented easily for the business guy of the team
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: Yes but idiomatic C and idiomatic C++ are very different, you'll end up picking up a bunch of bad habits
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: Just stick with C
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: Yeah
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: why
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: buffers make more sense than vectors
[ MESSAGE ]: qalvynn.: 
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: what do you think vectors are
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: and are overall easier
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: how
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: how is manually managing a buffer easier than using a std::vector lol
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: Otherwise you'd just write C code in a .cpp file
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: I mean, you can basically do that
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: const correctness for exemple is quite a modern concept; in java I don't remember ever seeing anything const
[ MESSAGE ]: .krrt: Got them!
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: But I don't think manual memory management is easier
[ MESSAGE ]: mikromolecule1100: uhm no
[ MESSAGE ]: .derktauto: C++ has raw pointers and certain casts too, but more specialized e.g `static_cast`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast` (safer one is bit_cast iirc). How "abstracted" are those vs C? For this example, I'd argue that C-style casts hide things from the programmer since they basically can do any of those casts in some precedence implicitly.

I've done C before but moved to C++ 2 years ago.
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: memory-wise, buffers make more sense since they're just "data" if you know what I'm saying

A "string" is a pointer to a null terminated sequence of characters in memory
[ MESSAGE ]: Arcane: <@450639647106662402> has reached level **3**. GG!
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: ...which probably should go in a .c file
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: uhm yes
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: what do you think a std::vector is
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: things may be "final", but the intend is elsewhere: to express what you would with a C-like #define, it's just a placeholder constant name
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: its just a pointer and two size_ts
[ MESSAGE ]: .krrt: I would, specially since lots of people aren’t aware of this feature
[ MESSAGE ]: .krrt: Sometimes talks are there to remind people that features exist
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: That thing about std::vector is true though
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: Yes, but beginners barely understand memory
[ MESSAGE ]: themovercell: It's better than buffer management
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: I started a year ago with reverse engineering
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: So C made a lot more sense
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: i mean its not that you SHOULDNT start with c
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: but like
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: I had a good foundation
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: it depends
[ MESSAGE ]: mikromolecule1100: strings are different and string operations are much easier in C++ than C
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: That's a different path where it might make more sense
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: that's again a tradeof that they don't care as much about the fine-lines
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: it doesnt work like that
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: more about the overal shape the program takes
[ MESSAGE ]: mikromolecule1100: same with dynamic array
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: echopeak01: C is way more useful for reverse engineering / low level stuff
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: I disagree
[ MESSAGE ]: mikromolecule1100: Take assembly then
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: I use C++26 on embedded platforms
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: so now college or uni?
[ MESSAGE ]: Python: 
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: anyway, I wish UML wasn't so implicitely tied to Java; there is nothing I can use to visualy describe my C++ projects
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: even the virtual/public/private/protected attributes of classes diagrams are very obviously specific to java
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: yeah but they have use cases
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: it doesnt work like that
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: one is not ubiquitously better than the other
[ MESSAGE ]: .derktauto: Also, I'm confused why some people say the compile-time features of C++ have a hit on "performance", which is more of a runtime thing. Templates are resolved and instantiated at compile time once before the indefinite amount of execution time the program spends.
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: you dont have to NOT understand how the stl works
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: for example
[ MESSAGE ]: .krrt: i'm surprised there's someone giving USBs at pycon, my mama always told me never to accept USBs from strangers
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: "Manual" isn't the same thing as "man pages"
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: Yeah, the way I see it you can basically write C code in CPP and use the features you find useful, it's a net win
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: ```c++
namespace MyEnum

  constexpr int
    Value1 = 1,
    Value2 = 3,
    Value3 = 5;
}
```
[ MESSAGE ]: melendowski: That's his US broke Iran's nuclear enrichment facility iirc
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Man pages are unofficial in the sense that it's not app developers who maintain them. There's a single group that maintains the one big collection of man pages, from what I understand
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: Oh I misunderstood, I thought you said it was powered by usb

[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: in a coordinated setting the bloat doesnt matter that much, as your workplace would just have its own standards

[ MESSAGE ]: poopymcpoopyhead: weird
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: good devs are everywhere, and ~~C~~bad  devs too
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: 15lgprodigy: sure, this might become a problem if your contributing to open source where people have much more freedom in how they write code
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: and if you, as a user, actually do want to encrypt something, often you damn well know what program you're using, so those can be listed as exceptions or "known good"
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: + enum need have same value

[ MESSAGE ]: inout0444: Will do, thanks again

but regardless, still an attack vector, though for your phone now
[ MESSAGE ]: melendowski: Not rly, big joke
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: of different types
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: maybe that they are under more pressure to deliver features tho
[ MESSAGE ]: yourlocalexplosivesexpert: whats the difference between sklearn and statsmodel? Do I use either one or do I use a mixture of both modules?
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: i think it's just that java attracts bad programmers because it was specifically designed to hold the developer's hand
[ MESSAGE ]: efuziom: because more "flexible" projects tends to use higher level languages
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: But that's not even a source of bloat itself, people can still write or import bloat in C

[ MESSAGE ]: spidy___: Topic - NAT (Network Address Translation)

So I get how NAT works - my router has one public IP and all my devices share it when connecting to stuff online. The router keeps track of which device sent what request and routes responses back correctly. But the same is not possible if someone tries to send data to my private PC without me asking for it.

But here's my question: Why can't we just tag our private IPs onto our public IP somehow? Like if my public IP is 203.0.113.5 and my PC's private IP is 192.168.1.10, why can't we use something like 203.0.113.5:192.168.1.10 to let people directly connect to my PC? Maybe that way we wont need TURN and STUN servers? I am sure there must be a very good reason for this but still curious

Is it just because routers aren't built to handle this kind of addressing, or is there some deeper technical reason this wouldn't work?

    target.draw(m_grid, states);

    states.texture = m_textures.at((m_textures_names[1])).get();

    target.draw(m_grid, states);

}
```

I am trying to draw my `sf::VertexArray`which has two textures (it's a board with staggered textures).

However, despite my most commendable efforts to have it work, I can't seem to figure out how to actually draw the array with two different textures without being obliged to use two different `sf::VertexArray`.

That's individual runs of two different datasets(10 million lines each) where the major difference is the ISO 8601 needs  me to convert the date format to epoch. 

I read csv files line by line, then parse them and store the information in a vector of structs. On the side, I keep a hash-struct where I store hashes to check for duplicate data. When I am done processing all lines, I sort the vector of structs by timestamp and write to a csv file.

[ MESSAGE ]: programming_enjoyer: > would using the rich library hinder me from learning python and the fundamentals?
no, terminal interfaces are not an essential part of python or its fundamentals. but it would make you not have to learn how terminal interfaces work on a deeper level (ansi codes). you could still learn about them if you're interested, and use rich anyways to not need to reinvent the wheel of terminal interfaces for the 100th time

[ MESSAGE ]: polllaris: Someone can correct me if this is wrong, but I think because the infrastructure the entire world is built on to understand only deals in a specific routing protocol which does not support that. In IPv4 you have 32 bits of information and none of them leave room to specify the internal IP address to connect to, and that's what we have available for **routing**, then on top of that specific protocol we have another one that is meant to be for a given application which the router (TCP or UDP) and those deal with none of that information. So with everything we have now there's nothing that can be used to route to specific addresses besides tracking which connections were initiated from where in the network. I think it's because .A) The protocol/infrastructure just doesn't exist and probably. .B) This subnet situation primarily exists to address the shortage of IPv4 addresses, with IPv6 there's more space for a lot more and everyone could. have a public one so it just isn't necessarily. But hypothetically there could probably be IPv[arbitrary-number] that has both the source ip, destination address, then actual destination address and it could work if routers were designed to use this arbitrary protocol.

[ MESSAGE ]: polllaris: I mean since the reason we have subnets right now is because there aren't enough IP addresses to be assigned to every device, the solution wouldn't be to introduce entirely new variants of IP or transport protocol that every device would have to be modified to even use, the solution would just be to use version 6 of IP which has enough data sent per header to contain addresses of a larger size to be assigned, hence if you want people connected directly to your device, the solution is to not use a subnet, and to use IPv6 and have other people use IPv6, since there's 16 bytes of addresses ``340282366920938463463374607431768211455`` rather than only ``4294967295``.

[ MESSAGE ]: fahim_0: This is how I am doing things:
- I am using std::ifstream and std::ofstream to handle file input and output streams.
- To read lines from these streams, I use std::getline. 
- To parse each line into individual tokens, I use std::stringstream  to extract csv values easily. 
- I defined a custom struct to represent each line's data, and I use operator overloading to sort by timestamp and equality checking for duplicate detection. 
- I store hashes of the processed structs in a std::unordered_set with a custom hash struct. 
- For converting strings to numbers, I use std::stoi, std::stoll, and std::stod to transform text to nums.  
- To handle ISO8601 timestamps, I parse them into a std::tm struct and then convert to epoch time using timegm. 
- I keep my valid entries in a std::vector for ordered storage and later use std::sort with the overloaded < operator to sort the data by timestamp. 
- I handle potential parsing errors with exception handling (try/catch) blocks, and I report errors or duplicates using std::cerr for diagnostic output and writing to a log file.

I am not sure how to improve on this. But I am actively thinking.

[ MESSAGE ]: polllaris: I think that for mocking it should be done where certain results are irrelevant, like you test if your code will interact with something abstract that will facilitate something else, if it doesn't you know the code is wrong, and you can extract functionality out and inject measurement points. If you're developing something that is going to use certain services (i.e. in code for specific implementation details that make up what you're doing) then you should spin up that thing and do an integration test of the code with it. If you're developing code to use a database, mocking the logic that uses an abstraction over it would make sense, but it is **impossible** to test if the code for interacting with the database is correct if you don't actually do it, like is it really answering "Does the code do what I think it does?", and for certain stuff the answer is just no, so it's better to do an integration test (still a "unit" test in this case) which is arguably very easy with libraries like testcontainers https://testcontainers.com/

[ MESSAGE ]: khaidanhnguyen: I'm writing a CLI app and came up with this input design of having a preset map of input paired directly with pointers to function. 

However, when I put `char* input` into `auto itr = registries.find(input)`, it couldn't reach the targeted function. But when I put `"home"` directly into `registries.find("home")`, it would be able to find it and reached `cmd1`.

Maybe it's because `char* input` is just a pointer, pointing to a *different* `"home"` than what set up in map `registries`, but I'm not sure. Can some one explain? Maybe also give me a review into the code and say if this is a good idea or not.

But then that would break stuff like:
```cpp
char c = -128;
c = c - c;
```following simple math rules, `c - c = 0`, but if we apply this "wraparound to 0" for the `- c`, because it's effectively just `- (-128)`, then the `c = c - c` expression would suddenly be equal to `c = c - 0` which is the same as `c = c`, which is a no-op.

[ MESSAGE ]: polllaris: I think that dealing with stubbed responses that you put in place for their code would be a valid way to test the correctness of your code if it is a lot like dealing with their API with how you pass information in and get information back and you are doing it directly because something can still go wrong with that in the future especially if it is something official. If that isn't preferable then another option is to stub API responses during tests and make it use stub server instead which wiremock is an option that could be used, less popular in python and not as good as the other language implementations of it from what I've seen. I think any tests that get you close to answering the question of the code doing what it's supposed to are better than none at all.

[ MESSAGE ]: stubedquestionanswerer: Me??
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: Also what really happens when you do `num = -num`, is that `-num` implicitly promotes the `char` to an `int` and takes the negative, yielding us the `int +128`, but when you try to assign that `int` to `num`, which is of type `char`, it needs to perform a narrowing cast again, which then overflows.

Best is to send individual unique data to each thread and let them churn, and finally merge that data when receiving them from each thread. Keep in mind that the less synchronization you do, the less data will be able to be split up and parallelized, meaning it's a balance of keeping each thread working instead of waiting for data.
Regarding a file, it is best to read them in chunks and push it to a thread that is free, and keep on doing this until nothing is left. In addition, usually reading a file means synchronized waiting for data, and that might slow things down, but if read in sequence, it might happen that it will speed things up, instead of having multiple threads reading from a single file. Lastly, the storage used may help with reading faster, especially with an SSD.

[ MESSAGE ]: nanpsycho: A follow-up question. 
I now understand that compiler assumes single threaded ness. 

However, since we are writing multi threaded code. Where 'a' would either be a global var or a variable passed by reference / as pointer to the functions starting the thread. 

The compiler can "see" that these two functions were started as threads and access the same variables. 

Shouldn't this be enough to break the original assumption?

The only case where I can think the above optimization be valid is if 'a' is a register that can be over written by another program that the compiler can't see and hence mistakenly optimizes out the loop to be an inf while loop.

Why not? 

because the compiler may not have access to the source code of all functions you call

foos: list[Any]

if random.random() > 0.5:

else:
    item = random.choice(bars)

[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: Google and StackOverflow have served us well for many years before LLMs were a thing. So yeah, recommend to check out these because usually you're not the first to encounter specific problems. Just make sure you break the problem down to simple steps that you can actually google for, e.g. instead of pasting the entire problem description you would google for 
- "Python how to get user input (from command line)"
- "Python How to print (to command line)"
- "Python Read data from file"
- ...

Also make sure to check out the documentations for the `csv` and `os` module.
[ MESSAGE ]: ameliawitchxoxo: Ill use readchar! Thanks alot
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: depending on what's in the TU this might be totally okay though - but it's an extremely nasty edge case
[ MESSAGE ]: Python: 
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: In other words: for an operation `f` and `x: A | B` is allowed only if `f(A)` and `f(B)` are allowed. This property is preserved when `A` is `Any`
[ MESSAGE ]: shenanigansd: No I just got curious and poked at Zendesk's API usage stats page because they made an announcement about overhauling the API section of their admin panel 
I don't think they even care, because they have a counter for "rate limit near breaches" and it's still at 0
[ MESSAGE ]: z_restricted: they were wondering why they were getting so many requests to sites hosting anime pics
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: this comes up *a lot* when you have polymorphic registration
my blog post on polymorphic registration is actually susceptible to do this
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: anyway point overall is that optimizations and compilers have "assumed" single threaded since forever, and if suddenly they should assume multi-threaded by default as soon as they aren't sure it would remove most forms of optimizations
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: I see, it's surprising to me the side effect wouldn't be propagated. For context my use case is a try/catch macro where the user might write something like
```cpp
CPPTRACE_TRY {
    ...
} CPPTRACE_CATCH(const std::exception& e) {
    ...
}
```and writing this macro uses a trick to instantiate `S<T>::x` and the side-effect is important for doing some static init on `S<T>`. If the function with the try/catch is used I expect the linker to handle things appropriately
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: anwar_dashet: Is it possible for me to send you a picture of the code that I made and you can modify it so that it does not appear to be artificial intelligence?
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Any propagating less is probably a good thing tbh
[ MESSAGE ]: preocts: Ah. then you haven't made enough API calls. <:yarrLUL:1163121312982646916>  It's a great day when one of your vendor's calls you to ask: Whacha doing? 
((less than a great day when that call includes multiple infosec teams and executives))
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: in polymorphic registration it's very common to have a TU that corresponds to some derived class, and nothing from the TU is actually used directly
you just have a global, and as a side effect of that global, you add the derived class factory to some registry, so that users can construct it later.

[ MESSAGE ]: rtsjammer: Hello, I think pattern matching for C++ would be great and am researching the current proposals. Structured bindings are a core part of both of the current proposals for pattern matching, namely <https://wg21.link/p2688r5> and <https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2392r3.pdf> . I am uncertain about some details. My questions are: Why are both proposals using `auto&&` instead of using or allowing for instance `auto` or `auto&` or `const auto`? What does this imply for nested structures like `[a, [b, [c, d], e], [f, g]]`? What if the inner identifiers (like `c`) are matched with values that have types that are reference types or types that have qualifiers like `const`? Is it the intention that binding modes cannot be chosen individually for each identifier? Some other languages have complex binding modes, like making an identifier bind as a reference or as a copied value, though I am unsure if that increased complexity is worth it, and I can see a number of apparent issues in at least some of those languages. I should mention that I do not have a good understanding of some of <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding> , like the interaction between the ref-qualifier of the structured binding and the types of the identifiers of it.

It's an unfortunate limitation of structured bindings currently.
[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: but you have to just not use it until it's casted to the right t ype
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: the exact level of "thread synchronization" that must be ensured by the compiler/codegen depends on the memory order you request
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: well you can cast anything to void*, yes, but you need to cast back to correct type

[ MESSAGE ]: chrisisgr8: ah if only i could read lmao. thanks!
[ MESSAGE ]: .plunder: There are different complexity spaces from crypto coins too.
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Yeah, but if you need this behavior, you're gonna do the same thing manually in C

[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: https://redskydigital.com/au/rocket-actix-or-axum-the-ultimate-rust-web-showdown/
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: i mean the compiler probably won't reject your code as ill-formed
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: In C you have to rely on the optimizer to lift this to compile-time. In C++ you can force it to happen at compile-time
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: why?
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: but you're causing undefined behavior
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I think it's not always that easy to compare the two, because the paradigms to approach abstractions wont be the same

[ MESSAGE ]: programming_enjoyer: redox
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: which is also why an atomic that is not lock-free will almost certainly be implemented through a mutex internally
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: oh
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: why not just `-E -P` then
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: the optimizer?
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: Lol
[ MESSAGE ]: qwinci: well one indirection less that's true if you inline the vtable in c
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: uutils
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: and there are many benchmarks online to show that C++ performs worst than C on many things
[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: as far as compiler goes gcc and clang both behave pretty similarly. i guess you need to use ubsan type programs or something to get more diagnostics.
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: though memcpy is a "magic" function in a sense
[ MESSAGE ]: shenanigansd: https://www.redox-os.org/
[ MESSAGE ]: halalaluyafail3: -P just filters out the location info
[ MESSAGE ]: halalaluyafail3: not headers
[ MESSAGE ]: x_elf: til. looks nifty
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: hm
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: when the compiler sees "memcpy" it already knows that its supposed to copy something
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: idk i didn't have issues with that
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: I need the init to run before any exception is thrown so I can hack with the vtable, this code path never actually runs. Not sure what trying to do something with a meyers singleton would do for me here since this never actually runs.
[ MESSAGE ]: shenanigansd: I have just found out that https://serenityos.org/ is _not_, in fact, Rust based
[ MESSAGE ]: el_nora: is it actually UB if the compiler you're using on that platform defines the behavior?
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: so it most likely won't even look at the implementation
[ MESSAGE ]: sasbom: trapped in samsara
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: of course not!
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: Nah it's a C++ dialect
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Yes, the part of your compiler that makes your programs faster by rewriting them. If you ask it to
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: Yeah, when you compile your source code you also add a flag `-O0`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`, `-Og`, `-Os`, ... and all of these specify a different optimization level. E.g. `-O0` is (almost) no optimizations, whereas `-O3` is (almost) all optimizations
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: If you ever look at the preprocessor output from real code that includes standard library headers, you will
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: Which brings me to my petition: Say "FUCK YOU" to the standard, and embrace the compiler as the ultimate arbiter of what goes and what doesn't
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: Called Serenity C++
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: I'm not sure what the difference it/what restrictions they impose
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: ok and why not just always use -03?
[ MESSAGE ]: awildprof: <:kekw:913205611095797810>
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: Formatting the preprocessor output is important too
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: We can actually look at the difference in this example:
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: ;asm -O0
```c
int f(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
[ MESSAGE ]: Compiler: 
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: ;asm -O3
```c
int f(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: It messes with debugging
[ MESSAGE ]: estebanlafo: <:smadge:1234665049126338596>
[ MESSAGE ]: Compiler: 
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: because O2 is enough and you want better program size
[ MESSAGE ]: el_nora: -pedantic will always exist for compilers that target multiple platforms
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: program size?
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: you need to rewrite the vtable so that it can be caught properly?
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: smaller executable
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: And takes more time to compile, so during development you might wanna faster iteration time by not using it

would it filter out the pragmas?
[ MESSAGE ]: zestar75: I effectively made the team refactor our product after I joined
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: Yeah, `-O3` can produce very long assembly codes, because it thinks that's faster (less assembly code isn't always faster)
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: and at the end a final compiliation of -03
[ MESSAGE ]: zestar75: Which is such a painful exercise. I learnt a lot.
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Yes
[ MESSAGE ]: sink_cat: > The system is written in what the authors call "Serenity C++",[15] a C++ coding style that avoids exceptions and features its own standard library.
[ MESSAGE ]: seha10: Is this code valid? It passes on gcc but fails on clang:

    T *ptr;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    if constexpr (false) {
        int x = f<int &>();
    }
}
```
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Also known as a release build vs a debug build
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: it is UB because it's outside the standard
I typically call that IB but even that is an abuse if you follow standard terminology, it's arguably more of an extension that exploits constructs the standard defines as UB to insert its own behaviour
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: There are other useful flags that make your program slower to check for more errors, that you'd only use in debug builds. The address sanitizer, for example
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: thats interesting because you would think less would be better since after assembly its all physical. i wonder how they calcualte its faster. does the compiler know how much time it physically takes to calculate every cpu instruction?
[ MESSAGE ]: nanpsycho: You mention caching. 

Can,

bool notify = false;

th1()
{
mutex::lock_gaurd l(mtx);
// Some work
notify = true;
notify_one();
}

th2()
{
{
mutex:: unique_lock l(mtx);
cv.wait(l, notify);
notify = false;
}
// Some work
}

Does this have the risk of caching causing a miss in cv.wait notification?
[ MESSAGE ]: halalaluyafail3: no
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: The compiler knows (or at least I think it does) how many cycles each instruction takes.
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: ok makes sens
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: i just changed it and now im getting this
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Invalid. `if constexpr` can only remove the errors that happen on templates and depend on template parameters
[ MESSAGE ]: fatlenny: sounds like king crimson on more acid than usual
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: But there are more factors than just "how long does each instruction take"
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: This try/catch mechanism is so that I can provide stack traces for arbitrary exceptions, the way it works is I intercept the search phase which happens during exception handling right before unwinding. For itanium, the search phase works by looking at type info for various possible handlers and it calls `__can_catch` to see if it's a match, I modify the vtable for the type info for the unwind interceptor and make `__can_catch` collect a trace for me
[ MESSAGE ]: zestar75: Statsmodel has models sklearn doesn’t have, specifically things related to time series. When there is an overlap I’d say that sklearn is about prediction and statsmodels is … about statistics, inference, interpretation etc.
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: way more factors, too many to list them all
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: That's how you learn!
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: The unwind interceptor itself is internal, it should never be thrown and can never be caught
[ MESSAGE ]: falsity: well obviously if you have 100 1 cycle instructs vs 1 30 cycle instruction it makes sense..
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: gotcha
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: But to name two: cache locality and branch prediction
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: that is commonly referred to as type punning or type puning, can't be bothered to remember the spelling
and that's just outright not allowed
[ MESSAGE ]: seha10: But why is `f<int>` instantiated? Isn't this a context where a definition is not required?
[ MESSAGE ]: nanpsycho: Should notify be a std::atomic ?
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: This is not valid code
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: oh it does look better though
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: but I think it's also an idiom war here

ofc if you can write a program in C, you can (likely) just compile it to C++ and claim "okay then any C code is slower than C++, because it cannot be strictly faster, since compiling that one code as C++ just would contradict the claim""

however, many C codes are considered to be anti-patterns for C++... so you're not going to work the same way in both languages. hence many things will start to become hard to compare truly
[ MESSAGE ]: marco.08: <@199943082441965577> static data members are instantiated only if odr-used. If the static data member is instantiated, and the constructor has side effects, the compiler must not elide the static data member, because the language guarantees that the constructor is invoked
[ MESSAGE ]: rtsjammer: I believe both of the proposals propose it, though maybe I am explaining it very poorly or have misunderstood something. <https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p2688r5.html#let-pattern> has nested structures, like `let [x, [y, z]]`.

[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: changing code around that change can impact how fast/slow that value change actually becomes visible to a different thread
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Are we sure this should compile tho?
[ MESSAGE ]: marco.08: this example compiles just because the definition of f is not needed, if you make f constexpr both clang and gcc will try to instantiate it

[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: I'm pretty sure based on the wording of the if constexpr spec.
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: > Unlike `std::endl`, this manipulator does not flush the stream.
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: In any case, you can always for example just return the Any | T back to the user - for the user, T will be some concrete thing
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: so returning Any | T back to the user isn't the same as returning them an object - now T is something concrete like `str`
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: this is just non-deterministic to a large extent and changing the code just fundamentally changes the level of guarantee that is/isn't required
[ MESSAGE ]: marco.08: gcc doesn't error because it can rollback instantiations during tentative constant evaluation
[ MESSAGE ]: seha10: why does it become needed if f is constexpr?
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: Any | str isn't the same as object - you can call `.capitalize()` on an `Any | str`
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: This one?
[ MESSAGE ]: tcprouting: ,ss nsa.gov
[ MESSAGE ]: bleed: 
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: for all I know your original piece of code with the atomic ends up requiring to publish all the changes made by the interrupting thread to the other thread
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: and maybe you actually want that, maybe you do not
[ MESSAGE ]: marco.08: it isn't needed, but both compilers try to evaluate it tentatively, gcc fails and rollbacks the instantiation, clang fails and errors
[ MESSAGE ]: jr.0: My reading of the standard is that the discarded expression is still instantiated because main isn't an enclosing templated entity <https://eel.is/c++draft/stmt.if#2.sentence-2> (this sentence and the next)

[ MESSAGE ]: rtsjammer: Looking at P0144R2 (I believe that is the most recent version, it was not adopted, but P0217R3 with wording was adopted) for structured bindings, they describe `auto&&` as being a "forwarding reference".

[ MESSAGE ]: dementati: To be honest, I think if you're looking for employment, your outlook's pretty grim. Even reaching the level of competence that you'll be expected to have is likely to take several years, especially if you're not able to focus on it full-time. In addition, junior hires are way down right now, and even people with university degrees are struggling. So even if you do manage to train yourself and somehow gather some kind of acceptable credentials, your chances of getting hired are not good in the current job market. If finding a career that pays the bills is your primary objective, I would make sure there aren't any better options before you head down this path.

[ MESSAGE ]: l3viathan: (or was it 2022?)
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: it works
[ MESSAGE ]: point1111: how young? im 15
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: I am fairly certain that memcpy in both languages deal with `void*`
[ MESSAGE ]: tigran.kh: So a consistent schedule might work better for you and yield better results
[ MESSAGE ]: quicknir: but they're still not the same. I mean Any | T doesn't have to be T, so that's a difference right there. If you T is concrete then, again, you can do an isinstnace check and handle the Any and T cases separately
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: and even then, it doesnt make much sense to plug any number in a pointer type ; but let's pretend
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: generic can pick the right function
[ MESSAGE ]: celestial_raccoon_80621: +1
[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: just like overloading functions in c++
[ MESSAGE ]: mariosis: I remember it having legit songs growing up
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: yes they deal with void * and claim to interpret said pointer(s) as `unsigned char *` pointers

[ MESSAGE ]: point1111: what?
[ MESSAGE ]: celestial_raccoon_80621: "me too"
[ MESSAGE ]: point1111: Ohh
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: yeah but you have to write the list of types first somewhere,
but I guess you can do that with X macros

[ MESSAGE ]: celestial_raccoon_80621: i like how python has something like `1 < var < 5` thats special to python, other languages dont evaluate all of them at once, by comparing 1 to 2, then  2 to 3 and then evaluting the bool
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: accessing any `T *` through a `unsigned char *`, is allowd
[ MESSAGE ]: salafion: can i ask something
[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: you have to use either union in c or i guess bit_cast in c++

[ MESSAGE ]: riogu7: true
[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: <@741186984684421143> so you have separate pointers alltogether and just copy the bytes over so it's not being punned?

[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: <@741186984684421143> if you "unroll" the memcpy would it be converting to a third pointer which was void * ?
[ MESSAGE ]: tienthedoc: that's what it seems is being done by passing it as an argument.
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: but type puning through an union in c, from a pointer to the original object/bytes, would also have to look like something
```c
void foo(int* ptr)
{
  union
  {
    int i;
    float f;
  } u = { .i = *ptr };
  printf("%f\n", u.f);
}
```
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: the `int *` is converted to a `void *` when passed to memcpy (implicitly)
then inside memcpy it is likely casted to `unsigned char *` to perform a byte-to- byte copy
[ MESSAGE ]: celestial_raccoon_80621: i havent been feeling like writing anything recently

[ MESSAGE ]: tigran.kh: I’ve been into computers for as long as I can remember—literally before I could speak. By age 3, I was already using one, yet I spoke at 4. My parents weren’t fans of video games, so I got more curious about how things worked instead. Around 8, I started following online tutorials and writing simple scripts in Batch and VBScript. I explored virtual machines, different OSes, and later went to HTML/CSS/JS classes—even though web dev wasn’t really my thing. By 11, I was dual-booting Linux to speed up our old PC, learning Bash because my mouse broke and I was too shy to say anything about it. That actually led me to Python, where I’ve done lots of small projects and learned a lot through experimenting.

If a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied, if it has one.

[ MESSAGE ]: hmd089932: thx
[ MESSAGE ]: lapinozz: just calling things weird for no reason?
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: turn it into an integer
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I am considering that example:
```c
assert(sizeof(int) == sizeof(float));

int *x = malloc(sizeof(*x));
// object T referred to by x, has no declared type

float *y = (void*)x;
// does not change effective type of T

*y = 2.f;
// effective type of T is float

printf("%d\n", *x); // Illegal, incompatible type

*x = 2;
// effective type of T is int

printf("%d\n", *x); // legal
```
The comments look wrong to me. I feel like this code is UB, but I cannot decide whether or not it violates this quote of the spec:

> The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is the declared type of the object, if any.72) If a value is stored into an object having no declared type through an lvalue having a type that is not a character type, then the type of the lvalue becomes the effective type of the object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the stored value. If a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied, if it has one. For all other accesses to an object having no declared type, the effective type of the object is simply the type of the lvalue used for the access.

so in other words:
- are the comments correct?
- is the code UB? if yes, why?

[ MESSAGE ]: rndpkt: if that is true, then you should just try to cast the string and then catch the exception if it can't
[ MESSAGE ]: toeger: If you stick to non-degenerate cases it becomes less complicated.
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: binary operator?
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: ??
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: is it correct to say, that the quote mentionned above, taken alone, is not enough to confirm there is UB
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: oh you mean `x in y` vs `for x in y`
[ MESSAGE ]: carcigenicate: Oh, ya, if you inherit then that will solve it.
[ MESSAGE ]: alplusplus: 5 optimization passes down, 5 more to go then LTO
[ MESSAGE ]: jellezijlstra: https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/concepts.html#gradual-types
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: now its saying this
[ MESSAGE ]: decorator_factory: What do you mean by sets of sets?
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: it has to be UB. Just imagine `sizeof(int) = 2` and `sizeof(float) = 4`. Then when you do `*y = 2.f` you write into 2 bytes of unallocated memory
[ MESSAGE ]: tigran.kh: Yeah
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: tigran.kh: I was confused about your confusion and then questioned my whole understanding of operators lol
[ MESSAGE ]: jellezijlstra: A gradual type represent a set of fully static types that it can materialize to
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: yeah yeah but let's assume alignment and size are all good
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: my dumbass thought binary meant bitwise
[ MESSAGE ]: TTS Bot: 
[ MESSAGE ]: whynotgs: wait a se
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: toeger: (That said, the degenerate cases should just work as well.)
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I'm actually focusing on the quote above alone
[ MESSAGE ]: ameliawitchxoxo: Alright thank you!
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I'm wondering if, from the perspectivr of that one quote, the code isnt actually fine
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: (but then: strict aliasing brings another constraint, and the code actually is UB)
[ MESSAGE ]: dementati: I guess the comprehension `for in` is a ternary operator...
[ MESSAGE ]: bakajal: How do I figure out all the headers that I need?
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: wait nvm there no error
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: its just pure empty
[ MESSAGE ]: kazani.dev: although obviously it
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: 
[ MESSAGE ]: bharadwajraju: A quaternary with the condition
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I feel like from the perspective of the quote I made, then the code is fine

but *then* there are also strict aliasing rules, that would actually make the code UB, as an additional set of constraints
[ MESSAGE ]: dementati: Yeah
[ MESSAGE ]: dementati: But then you need another keyword
[ MESSAGE ]: axololly: that's because `x in y` is `y.__contains__(x)`. if `y` is a native collection datatype, that will be written in C, which isn't speed-limited by the interpreter
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Consider asking on stackoverflow. They love those
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: Or I can ask if you prefer
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: now its giving me this
[ MESSAGE ]: mrlethal_.: <@1106069426702405704> dupe ssh
[ MESSAGE ]: holyblackcat: You download all headers the library has
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: now this
[ MESSAGE ]: bakajal: The github page says `This library requires boost 1.64 with which it is released.`
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: its put the image in a seperate window
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: =====
so in other words: I'm convinced strict aliasing rules would make that code UB
[ MESSAGE ]: kazani.dev: atp I think I'm just measuring the python for loop speed lmao
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: toeger: Link it, I somewhat recently got my 10k rep and I think I can unilaterally close it as a dupe now.
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: but I'd like to know if the quote above, actually is powerful enough to reveal UB. or if on the contrary, it is permissive
[ MESSAGE ]: carcigenicate: If we're into Tkinter-specific problems, I can't help unfortunately. I mainly commented because I saw you doing `Tk()` multiple times, and know that that can cause issues.
[ MESSAGE ]: aviationlolz: ohh ok
[ MESSAGE ]: saqib.com: It doesnt? I thought it does flush after writing null.
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: The thing with the quote is that it shouldn't apply, no?

>  If a value is stored into an object having no declared type through an lvalue having a type that is not a character type, then the type of the lvalue becomes the effective type of the object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the stored value.
We store literals, i.e. rvalues. So this lvalue part should not be relevant.

> If a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied, if it has one.
We don't use `memcpy` or `memmove`, nor do we use a character array, so this also shouldn't apply.

> The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is the declared type of the object, if any.
> For all other accesses to an object having no declared type, the effective type of the object is simply the type of the lvalue used for the access.
This is the only part that actually applies, no?

While writing this I believe in realising why your code is different. Your has like a way to handle any other input than s number right? Mine just states that it doesnt need a string or a negative number, but it doesnt handle the case of someone writing a string or a negative number in the input. Am I correct?

[ MESSAGE ]: .guts_69: nothing load
[ MESSAGE ]: base_13: cross platform UI especially for android
[ MESSAGE ]: .makian: Meh
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: I think in terms of which part of the spec is violated, I'm more and more convinced that the initial quote, about effective types, we got it entirely correct from the start
[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: you like rock and didnt like it?
[ MESSAGE ]: programming_enjoyer: haskell is for weaponizing autism

[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: how come?
[ MESSAGE ]: base_13: I hate that mobiles make things over complicated for "sake of security" which at the end never completes
[ MESSAGE ]: szejmon: yeah but then I don't know what error occurred
[ MESSAGE ]: .makian: This is soft rock or something, not my jam
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: but then the "second" access to the object, which should give it a new effective type, is prohibited by aliasing rules
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: and that's where the UB starts
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: hmm yeah softer rock a little bit
[ MESSAGE ]: electro199: Python not even have single UI framework completely written in python
[ MESSAGE ]: shenanigansd: Hello,

If you want to weaponize me, you're gonna need a better system
Thanks
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: (in my understanding of the spec)
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: (you just need to propose it first and wait for C++44)
[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: <@1207176735930716231> did you see austria? incredible voice
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: you can change the effective type through the following clause arguably, but you have to go through the appropriate magic function
> If a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied, if it has one.
the object allocated through malloc has "no declared type" but has an effective type because of the earlier `*y = 2.f;`
I *think* the intent is that `*x = 2;` shouldn't be legal wrt the previous clause because then why is there this following clause
[ MESSAGE ]: Python: Hello, <@585641451229020168>! Wondering why you can't talk in the voice channels? Click the Voice Verify button above to verify. If you don't yet qualify, you'll be told why!
[ MESSAGE ]: .makian: More importantly, lorna shore dropped a new song, gotta listen now
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: I'm also confused why you would have a non-fatal assertion
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: doesn't that make it annoying to debug?
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: ```CMake Error: The source directory "C:/Users/tweakeroo/Desktop/projects/llvm-project-main/llvm" does not exist.

[ MESSAGE ]: cosindine: 
[ MESSAGE ]: speedyslug: I usually create a type derived from `std::exception` as my base exception type, then just have a class which returns a string literal from `what()` almost entirely because of this
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: 
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: ?
[ MESSAGE ]: saradomin: whats the name?
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: but then again I'm not a c person and even in c the clause allowing type puning through union makes no sense to me because of how a different clause is worded
[ MESSAGE ]: .bast.: unfortunately it's literally impossible to do so because the OS only exposes ui frameworks to either C (windows, linux) or obj c/swift (macos)
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: There's Toga
[ MESSAGE ]: .makian: Oblivion
[ MESSAGE ]: ruukha: update: when changing the import to import.module, it changed the error to "ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package". Dont know if that could be of use
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: or how is a non-fatal assertion different to a print anyway ?
[ MESSAGE ]: slybach: but eh, I'd have to read the c standard more closely
[ MESSAGE ]: elmonkeking: I mean I guess we can kinda do it with a `union`:
```c
union Foo {
    int x;
    float v;
};
```
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: and what is the location of that?
[ MESSAGE ]: electro199: Even Pyqt is not completely documented for python you mostly use C++ docs
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: nvm
[ MESSAGE ]: thurisatic: i feel like having a fully-boostrapped ui framework is incredibly rare. c, c++, java/kotlin, js/ts, swift?
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: im ducnk
[ MESSAGE ]: .nullvoidnan: eyes watering *yawns*
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: all good
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: Tho IG that one will have a bunch of interop stuff
[ MESSAGE ]: carcigenicate: Sorry, idk. That TMX does cointain the integer `307`, but I can't find anything resembling `307.414` in the data, so I'm not sure where that value is coming from.
[ MESSAGE ]: .bast.: js doesn't count
[ MESSAGE ]: .bast.: because it was added to an existing fully built ui toolkit
[ MESSAGE ]: .bast.: in firefox's case it was XUL
[ MESSAGE ]: electro199: _add to list_
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: in my understanding, the quote claims effective types but there is this part:
> for subsequent accesses **that do not modify the stored value**.

so in my understanding, `*x = 2;` is an instruction the quote does not cover
[ MESSAGE ]: .guts_69: oh it s not a probleme dw thank you sm for your help
[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: I wonder how real Toga is
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: (**but** such instruction actually is illegal, as per strict aliasing rules)
[ MESSAGE ]: .nullvoidnan: operation 29 out of 69... nice
[ MESSAGE ]: .bast.: oh toga is part of beeware
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: oh yeah yeah sure
[ MESSAGE ]: electro199: it is true but using ctypes to use dll can do the trick
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: here I was really just trying to understand the spec
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: so I think you're right in saying:
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: cmake is actually op
[ MESSAGE ]: tweakeroo.: once u get how it works
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: well, in that example at least
[ MESSAGE ]: ruukha: turns out this seems to happen with all imports from local modules?
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: it's ugly and kinda horrible
but it's used widely and decent enough
[ MESSAGE ]: base_13: java(android)
[ MESSAGE ]: judekeyser: because strict aliasing rules actually prevent any other write-access that is done through an incompatible pointer type (w.r.t. the previously identified effective type)
[ MESSAGE ]: 9291sam: any place that you'd use a warning to log something.

```cpp
assert::warn(
    maybeCompiledCode->maybe_warnings.empty(),

[ MESSAGE ]: shikennuggets: Or accidentally disable critical code by changing a compile time log level or something
[ MESSAGE ]: killjoy1221: I think android is a hard fork from years ago. It isn't modern Linux
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: tbf it's a good catalyst for an evolution that must happen industry-wide either way
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: so you can start a timer that waits 3 seconds, then does cancels the io on the subprocess and kills it, or something
[ MESSAGE ]: tsche: it's ridiculous to use x86 processors on a mobile device like a laptop

[ MESSAGE ]: wakamatsu: a global log :(
[ MESSAGE ]: kilozz: modern linux meaning the kernel?

[ MESSAGE ]: bakajal: Oh I see
[ MESSAGE ]: bakajal: thanks
[ MESSAGE ]: kilozz: its on 5.15 as of the latest android version
[ MESSAGE ]: chozorho: obligatory
[ MESSAGE ]: hazfox: Slide rule uses a fact that log(a*b) == log(a) + log(b)
And log_n(a*n^m) = log_n(a) +m
So you just operate on log_10 and scientific notation (so n=10, and a,b <10). You keep power of 10 in your memory (do simple +- on scientific notations' powers, sometimes +-1 when sum of logs moves)
As I said, more useful in physics and similar stuff where it's just a lot of multiplication for numbers in scientific notation and not exact values.
[ MESSAGE ]: vova65: did it take lot of RAM on user pc?
[ MESSAGE ]: melak47: there is an example with timers here: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/doc/html/boost_asio/examples/cpp11_examples.html#boost_asio.examples.cpp11_examples.timers

[ MESSAGE ]: hazfox: Convert to scientific notation. So 3.27e2*8.2e2
Add powers in head or write them down.

Find 3.27 on outer ruler. (Length from 0 to 3.27 == log_10(3.27) because ruler has logarithmic scale). 
Slide inner ruler's 0 to that. Find 8.2 on the inner rule. (Length on the inner ruler == log_10(8.2))

If the mark of inner ruler's 8.2 falls within the outer ruler, just read the result (because log_10(a)+log_10(b) = log_10(a*b) - combined lengths give the length of multiplied)

But it's fucking 3*8, it's >10
So it doesn't fall within length of outer ruler.
So instead it's +1 to power and instead you gotta do some magic I don't remember by subtracting from end of the ruler... Easily proven by maths what to do there, but it's past midnight and my brain is not really braining anymore

[ MESSAGE ]: dot42: that 10% advantage can easily be explained by apple almost consistently having a node advantage. like, the latest Ryzen AI stuff is basically within like 10% of the Apple M4, but the M4 is a whole node ahead.

[ MESSAGE ]: lakmatiol: It doesn't matter as much as you might think. I'd probably suggest against starting with C++ (the language has a lot to it that isn't useful for learning programming), and against starting with C outside of a university environment (the language isn't very productive). But even with those choices it's fine.

[ MESSAGE ]: napster8: thank
[ MESSAGE ]: Python: 
[ MESSAGE ]: dot42: the only thing where Apple has consistently shown a definitive and clear advantage is idle power usage and single-core performance.
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: (neoverse cores arent shitty)

[ MESSAGE ]: bro_fedka: Well, I got what I needed
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: the #1 nice thing of arm is that you as a big company can go 'let me make my own cpu' and glue together some shit and have a fully functional thing
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: ```c++
#define param1(name1, body) [](const auto name1) constexpr { body; }
#define param2(name1, name2, body) [](const auto name1) constexpr\
{ is$ [mov(name1)](const auto name2) constexpr \
    { body ;};}
```
can i make it more generic?
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: that performs well
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: in 2 years
[ MESSAGE ]: dot42: yeah, my point is that I really don't think there's much actual data to back up the notion that ARM is somehow inherently so much better than x86. it has some advantages, but they don't seem to matter a lot, at least in high-performance applications. I don't think Apple's secret is ARM.
[ MESSAGE ]: eczbek: lambdas are implicitly constexpr
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: oh
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: Carl-bot Logging: 
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: well in a sense it is arm because it allows them to make their own cpu :^)

[ MESSAGE ]: nou2917: I’m glad that I’m running a lot more consistently the previous  month and this month
[ MESSAGE ]: dot42: yeah, but the reason they're great is not because they use the ARM ISA
[ MESSAGE ]: ekim0000: for second is just much simlier
[ MESSAGE ]: dot42: it's because they built a damn good system that just happens to use the ARM ISA.
[ MESSAGE ]: beached_k_whale: memory bandwidth is often better too, I think

[ MESSAGE ]: chuyi.wang: thank you
[ MESSAGE ]: _64: you can draw a direct line from having a hideously complicated variable width encoding to having a smaller decode width
[ MESSAGE ]: yeoldtoasty: The manager always tells me that I shouldn't worry about such things, but if there's nothing negative then theres nothing to improve and if there's nothing to improve, then that can't be real, because everyone has at least a small area that they should improve upon. So the feedback makes me worry a bit more, especially when I compare myself to the mid and senior level engineers

How to show drag n drop address/result in entry widget instead of changing the label?
